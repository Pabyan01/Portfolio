# Adobe Creative Cloud is a set of cross—platform applications from Adobe Systems distributed by subscription.

It provides users with access to a collection of software for:

graphic design;

photo and video editing;

web development;

access to cloud services.

The cloud was first hosted on Amazon Web Services, and since September 2016 on Microsoft Azure.

Adobe Creative Cloud retains many of the features of Adobe Creative Suite and provides new features, such as instant application of updates, saving data to the cloud and simple sharing.
